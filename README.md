## Introduction

This project is designed to fulfill the challenge of implementing a backend to serve JSON data and a frontend to display it. The backend returns city data via a REST API endpoint, and the frontend retrieves and presents this data through a table and a map.

## Features

- REST API backend built using Node.js and Express to serve JSON data.
- React frontend with interactive components written in TypeScript to display city data.
- Interactive map visualization using the react-deck-gl and react-map-gl libraries.
- City data in the table can be sorted by columns.
- Clicking on a city in the table highlights its location on the map.
- Integration with Mapbox for map rendering.

## Setup

Before running the project, make sure to provide your Mapbox access token as an environment variable:

```bash
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN=<your-mapbox-token>
```

- To install necessary packages run `sh ./init.sh` from the root directory of the project.
- To run app execute `sh ./run.sh` from the root directory of the project.
- Backend should be running on http://localhost:8080
- Frontend should be running on http://localhost:3000

## Known Issues
During the development of this project, the following issue was encountered and addressed:
- **Map Component Resize Issue:** The map component did not resize properly when the window width changed.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, the following enhancements are planned for this project:

- Implementation of individual city pages using React Router.
- Retrieval and display of landmark data for each city.
- Further improvement of UI/UX design for a polished user experience.
